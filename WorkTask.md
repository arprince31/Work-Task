# How To Guide:

## For creating a Matillion account

You will also need to know your Matillion use cases and your Cloud Data Platforms, if any.  

The options available for each are detailed in the appropriate part of these instructions below.  

Go to the URL for the Matillion hub: hub.matillion.com/register and the following will be displayed.
